# BLOBCache

This solution provides a new ribbon button on the Manage Web Applications page within Central Administration. By highlighting a Web Application, a SharePoint Administrator can modify all available settings for the BLOB cache, as well as flush the BLOB cache. Because this solution deploys the settings to all SharePoint servers in the farm running the Foundation Web Service, it is important to have a BLOB cache location that is identical and available on all SharePoint servers.

3 solutions are available on the Releases page, one for each version of SharePoint Server: 2010, 2013, 2016, and 2019.
